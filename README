Crypt::Rainbow
==============

Rainbow is 128-bit block cipher that accepts a 128-bit key. Designed by
Chang-Hyi Lee and Jeong-Soo Kim of Samsung Advanced Institute of
Technology, Rainbow is similar to the block ciphers Square and Shark.

Rainbow was submitted as an AES candidate but was rejected because it
was deemed not "complete and proper", based on the requirements
specified by NIST in the Federal Register on September 12, 1997.

BONUS

The C file, _rainbow.c, is a standalone Rainbow implementation. To
compile it, type:

        gcc -Wall _rainbow.c

A new binary, a.out, will be created.

To run the binary, type:

        ./a.out
